# FILFlix

https://filflix.vercel.app/

FILFlix is a platform where users can buy/subscribe to content (music, books, videos) directly from the content creators as NFTs

FILFlix users can buy content by buying content NFTs, or subscribing with Subscription NFTs. The fees directly goes to the creators. The users get notified when a new content is created and the subscribers can schedule calls with creators
FILFlix creators can create new content NFTs that users can buy, on buying creators get paid directly.

This helps the creators to not go through the 3rd parties and sell directly to users. Users get ownership of content with NFT access and content stored on IPFS/FIlecoin.
